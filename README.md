# MARTESOLWIN

A program to compute Sun's horizontal coordinates from a set of positions on Mars' surface

## Outline

The routine MARTESOL computes the horizontal coordinates of the Sun from an arbitrary point on the Mar’s surface. To this end, first the position of Mars with respect to the Sun is obtained using an approximate ephemeris that allow the computation of the Martian Cartesian coordinates in the ICRF [(Standish, 1992)](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/approx_pos.html). In a second step, the routine computes the angles that specify the orientation of the Mars figure also in the ICRF, i.e., the right ascension and declination of the planet’s north pole, and its proper rotation angle, based on the fit given by [Archinal et al. (2018)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10569-017-9805-5). The first two angles are then transformed to the obliquity and the ascending node of the body equator of date with respect to the Earth Equinox at J2000.0. Let $\vec{R} = \left(R+h; \lambda; \varphi \right)$ be the position vector of a point on Mars’ surface, where $R$ is the reference radius of Mars, $h$ is the height above $R$, $\lambda$ is the longitude and $\varphi$ is the latitude. These values are obtained from a topographic file. If $\vec{r}_\odot$ is the position vector of the Sun with respect to Mars, and $\vec{r}$ is the position vector of Mars with respect to the Sun, then it is evident that: $\vec{R} + \vec{r} + \vec{r}_\odot = \vec{0}$ which allow to obtain the components of $\vec{r}_\odot$. Before performing the computation of the rectangular components of $\vec{r}_\odot$, the components of $\vec{r}$ must be transformed to the equatorial reference frame of Mars. Finally, the components of $\vec{r}_\odot$ are transformed to the local horizontal system by three consecutive rotations, from which the azimuth and altitude of the Sun from a specific point on the Mars’ surface are computed and for a specific date.
